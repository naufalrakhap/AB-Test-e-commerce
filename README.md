# AB-Test-e-commerce
Running an a/b test on an e commerce website. We would like to know whether new website will give huge impact or not if it is compared with old website regarding the decision of user to pay/purchase the products.
In this A/B Test 3 methods are being used to judge/decide both new website and old website impact, as follow :
  1. Hypothesis Testing
  2. Two sample Z test
  3. Logistic Regression

In summary based on our model test that has been done, it is necessary to keep the old page since new website page don't give direct impact for user to pay the products.
